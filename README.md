# CPU-Scheduler
The application allows users to select a CPU scheduling algorithm (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin) and dynamically add processes while the scheduler is running. The scheduling is visualized in real time, with 1 second representing 1 unit of CPU time. The user can also choose to run only the currently loaded processes without live updates
